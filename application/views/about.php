		<h2>About Us</h2>
		</h3>Attendum</h3>
		<p>Attendum is in two main sections.</p>
		<p>The first is a fun game for students to gain achievements and even prizes for attending lectures. They can track their progress 
			and compare with their friends and other classmates. </p>
		<p>The second section of Attendum is the ability for the university to use this data to find out early on I there are any problematic 
			areas where for some reason or other the attendance has greatly dropped for a certain module. If this happened the university would 
			be given enough notice to investigate and hopefully solve the problem. </p>
		<h3>Sudo Team</h3>
		<p>We are a collection of computer science students with 10 years’ experience between us from 2 countries. We created this website in 
		24 hours at the DevXS conference. </p>
